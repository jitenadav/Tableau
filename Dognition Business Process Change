I Did this small Business Analytics project in my Data Visualization & Communication w/ Tableau Course.
In this I given my insights on the Data provided by a company Named Dognition. This is a company that provides a platform to play games
with your Dog and understand your Dogs traits.
Dognition was facing a problem of Customers not completing enough game so that Data could be gathered on Dogs' behaviour.
They wants us to increase the number of test users complete.
